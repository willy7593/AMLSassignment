Run Classification.py to get all the results.

You can make the number of epochs larger to get more accurate result but will take longer.

cnn2.py is the unfinished attept that works.
cnn3.py is the final finished function for CNN.
csv1.py is the function that compares the prediction and actual and store it into csv.
