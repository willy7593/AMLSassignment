ensure inside the dataset folder, there are dataset, attribute_list.csv and haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

Then make sure csv1.py, classification.py and cnn3.py are all in the directory.

Classification.py is the main file while cnn3 and csv1 are the files that contains the functions to be called.

Run Classification.py to get all the results.

You can make the number of epochs larger to get more accurate result but will take longer.





cnn.py is the attept that I've done first but didn't work, explained in report.
cnn2.py is the unfinished attept that works.
cnn3.py is the final finished function for CNN.
cnn4.py is another CNN algorithm model.
csv1.py is the function that compares the prediction and actual and store it into csv.
classification.py is the main file.
Task1.csv is the result for Emotion recognition
Task2.csv is the result for Age identification
Task3.csv is the result for Glasses recognition
Task4.csv is the result for Human recognition
Task5.csv is the result for Hair Colour recognition

Note: if want to use cnn4.py, please change "from cnn3 import CNN_for_tasks" to "from cnn4 import CNN_for_tasks"  in classification.py.
